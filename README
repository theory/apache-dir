Apache/Dir version 0.02
=======================

    This simple module is designed to be a partial replacement for the
    standard Apache mod_dir module. One of the things that module does is
    to redirect browsers to a directory URL ending in a slash when they
    request the directory without the slash. Since mod_dir seems do its
    thing during the Apache response phase, if you use a Perl handler, it
    won't run. This can be problematic if the Perl handler doesn't likewise
    take the directory redirecting into account.

    A good example is HTML::Mason. If you've disabled Mason's decline_dirs
    parameter (MasonDeclineDirs 0 in httpd.conf), and there's a dhandler in
    the directory /foo, then for a request for /foo, /foo/dhandler will
    respond. This can wreak havoc if you use relative URLs in the dhandler.
    What really should happen is that a request for /foo will be redirected
    to /foo/ before Mason ever sees it.

    This is the problem that this module is designed to address. Thanks to
    mod_perl's ability to stack handlers, you can just make sure that
    Apache::Dir handles requests before Mason does. Configuration would
    then look something like this:

      <Location /foo>
        PerlSetVar  MasonDeclineDirs 0
        PerlModule  Apache::Dir
        PerlModule  HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
        SetHandler  perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::Dir HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
      </Location>
